# Obelix & Co. Webshop ðŸª¨

Currently, everything is under `obelix-webshop`, but we have great plans to split parts to split the most important part, my standing stones, into its own microservice.
Gradle subprojects are already in place, ready for the great change.

## Change Timeline


I even made a nice picture of the target architecture:

# Future

- An actual DB
- Distributed Tracing
- Split the basket into its own microservice, too
- Testing with Testcontainers
- Health checks for Actuator
